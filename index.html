    <p><b>Self-reflection</b> is the ability to witness and evaluate one's own cognitive, <mark>emotional</mark>, and behavioural
         processes. In psychology, other terms used for this self-observation include "reflective awareness" 
         and "reflective consciousness", which originate from the work of William James. <sup>[2][3]</sup>
         <br />
         <br>
        Self-reflection depends upon a range of functions, including introspection and metacognition, which 
        develop from infancy through adolescence, affecting how individuals interact with others, and make 
        decisions.[4]
        <br />
        <br>
        Self-reflection is related to the philosophy of consciousness, the topic of awareness, and the 
        philosophy of mind.[5]
        <br/>
        <br>
        The concept of self-reflection is ancient. More than 3,000 years ago, 
        "Know thyself" was the first of three Delphic maxims inscribed in the forecourt of the Temple 
        of Apollo at Delphi.[6] It is also considered a form of thought that generates new meaning[7] 
        and an opportunity to engage with what seemingly appears incongruous.[8]
